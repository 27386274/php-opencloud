 - Core change to method/property overloading. For every private model property, the end-user now has access to a dynamic getter/setter methods that ensure better encapsulation. For finer-grained control, they can specify concrete methods which supercede the magic methods. I want to get into the habit of encouraging filtered access through methods rather than raw property access.
