{"name":"php-opencloud","tagline":"a library for developers using PHP to work with OpenStack clouds","body":"See the\r\n[COPYING](https://github.com/rackspace/php-opencloud/blob/master/COPYING)\r\nfile for license and copyright information.\r\n\r\nNow running continuous integration at\r\n[travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org/rackspace/php-opencloud)\r\n\r\nFor other SDKs, see http://developer.rackspace.com\r\n\r\nThe PHP SDK should work with most OpenStack-based cloud deployments,\r\nthough it specifically targets the Rackspace public cloud. In\r\ngeneral, whenever a Rackspace deployment is substantially different\r\nthan a pure OpenStack one, a separate Rackspace subclass is provided\r\nso that you can still use the SDK with a pure OpenStack instance\r\n(for example, see the `OpenStack` class (for OpenStack) and the\r\n`Rackspace` subclass).\r\n\r\nSee the [Release Notes](https://github.com/rackspace/php-opencloud/blob/master/RELEASENOTES.md)\r\nfor what has changed in the latest release(s).\r\n\r\nSee the [php-opencloud wiki](https://github.com/rackspace/php-opencloud/wiki)\r\nfor incidental notes mostly aimed at developers who are working *on* the\r\nSDK (and not developers working *with* the SDK).\r\n\r\nDownloading\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nVisit https://github.com/rackspace/php-opencloud/tags to see tagged releases\r\nthat you can download.\r\n\r\nYou can download the master branch using the\r\nGitHub \"ZIP\" button, above. However, this has the latest code and may not\r\nbe as stable as the tagged branches.\r\n\r\nSupport and Feedback\r\n--------------------\r\nYour feedback is appreciated! If you have specific problems or bugs with the\r\n**php-opencloud**\r\nlanguage bindings, please file an issue via Github.\r\n\r\nFor general feedback and support requests, send an email to:\r\n\r\nsdk-support@rackspace.com\r\n\r\nYou can also find assistance via IRC on #rackspace at freenode.net.\r\n\r\nGetting Started with OpenStack/Rackspace\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nTo sign up for a Rackspace Cloud account, go to\r\nhttp://www.rackspace.com/cloud and follow the prompts.\r\n\r\nIf you are working with an OpenStack deployment, you can find more\r\ninformation at http://www.openstack.org.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nWe are not able to test and validate every possible combination of PHP\r\nversions and supporting libraries, but here's our recommended minimum\r\nversion list:\r\n\r\n* PHP 5.3 (note: Travis validates against 5.4 and 5.5 as well)\r\n* CURL extensions to PHP\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nIn the .zip or .tar file in which you received the library, everything under\r\nthe `lib/` directory should be installed in a location that is accessible. If you're not using a dependency manager like Composer, you will have to register the OpenCloud namespace for your app to use:\r\n\r\n    // Define the path to the library\r\n    $libraryPath = '/path/to/php-opencloud';\r\n\r\n    // Include the autoloader\r\n    require_once $libraryPath . '/Autoload.php';\r\n\r\n    // Register the root OpenCloud namespace\r\n    $classLoader = new SplClassLoader('OpenCloud', $libraryPath . '/lib');\r\n    $classLoader->register();\r\n\r\nOnce the OpenCloud namespace is registered, you will be able to access all functionality by referencing the class's namespace (in full PSR-0 compliance). For more information about namespaces, check out [PHP's documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php).\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\nIf you'd like to contribute to **php-opencloud**, see the\r\n[HACKING.md](https://github.com/rackspace/php-opencloud/blob/master/HACKING.md)\r\nfile in the root directory.\r\n\r\nFurther Reading\r\n---------------\r\nThe file\r\n[docs/quickref.md](https://github.com/rackspace/php-opencloud/blob/master/docs/quickref.md)\r\ncontains a Quick Reference\r\nguide to the\r\n**php-opencloud** library.\r\n\r\nThe source for the \"Getting Started with\r\n**php-opencloud**\" document (the user guide) starts in\r\n[docs/userguide/index.md](https://github.com/rackspace/php-opencloud/blob/master/docs/userguide/index.md).\r\n\r\nThere is a complete (auto-generated) API reference manual in the\r\ndocs/api directory. Start with docs/api/index.html.\r\n\r\nSee the [HOWTO.md](https://github.com/rackspace/php-opencloud/blob/master/HOWTO.md) file for instructions on\r\nregenerating the documentation and running tests.\r\n\r\nSee the [smoketest.php](https://github.com/rackspace/php-opencloud/blob/master/smoketest.php) file for some\r\nsimple, working examples. This is a test we run before builds to ensure that all\r\nthe core functionality is still working after code changes.\r\n\r\nThe [samples/](https://github.com/rackspace/php-opencloud/tree/master/samples/) directory has a collection\r\nof tested, working sample code. Note that these may create objects in your cloud\r\nfor which you could be charged.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-38459837-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
