{"name":"php-opencloud","tagline":"a software development kit (SDK) to help developers using PHP to work with OpenStack and other open clouds","body":"Getting started with **php-opencloud** is easy. Move the files in the `lib/` directory to \r\na location accessible from your script, then include either `openstack.php` or\r\n`rackspace.php` (depending upon which system you're using).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    <?php\r\n    require_once('/path/to/lib/rackspace.php');\r\n    // authenticate\r\n    $cloud = new Rackspace(array('username'=>$USERNAME,'password'=>$PASSWORD));\r\n    // connect to a service\r\n    $compute = $cloud->Compute('cloudServersOpenStack','ORD');\r\n    // create a new server\r\n    $server = $compute->Server();\r\n    $server->Create(array(\r\n        'name'=>'My Server',\r\n        'image'=>$compute->Image($IMAGEID),\r\n        'flavor'=>$compute->Flavor($FLAVORID)));\r\n\r\nThere's a lot more to it, of course, so check out the documentation.\r\n\r\nThe PHP SDK should work with most OpenStack-based cloud deployments,\r\nthough it specifically targets the Rackspace public cloud. In\r\ngeneral, whenever a Rackspace deployment is substantially different\r\nthan a pure OpenStack one, a separate Rackspace subclass is provided\r\nso that you can still use the SDK with a pure OpenStack instance\r\n(for example, see the `OpenStack` class (for OpenStack) and the\r\n`Rackspace` subclass).\r\n\r\nSee the [Release Notes](php-opencloud/blob/master/RELEASENOTES.md)\r\nfor what has changed in the latest release(s).\r\n\r\nThe [official documentation](http://docs.rackspace.com/sdks/guide/content/php.html)\r\nincludes an API reference as well as a quick-reference guide.\r\n\r\nSee the [php-opencloud wiki](https://github.com/rackspace/php-opencloud/wiki)\r\nfor incidental notes mostly aimed at developers who are working *on* the\r\nSDK (and not developers working *with* the SDK).\r\n\r\nDownloading\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nVisit https://github.com/rackspace/php-opencloud/tags to see tagged releases \r\nthat you can download.\r\n\r\nYou can download the master branch using the \r\nGitHub \"ZIP\" button, above. However, this has the latest code and may not\r\nbe as stable as the tagged branches.\r\n\r\nSupport and Feedback\r\n--------------------\r\nYour feedback is appreciated! If you have specific problems or bugs with the\r\n**php-opencloud**\r\nlanguage bindings, please file an issue via Github.\r\n\r\nFor general feedback and support requests, send an email to:\r\n\r\nsdk-support@rackspace.com\r\n\r\nGetting Started with OpenStack/Rackspace\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nTo sign up for a Rackspace Cloud account, go to\r\nhttp://www.rackspace.com/cloud and follow the prompts.\r\n\r\nIf you are working with an OpenStack deployment, you can find more\r\ninformation at http://www.openstack.org.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis code is released under a MIT license; see the COPYING file in the main repository for complete details.
